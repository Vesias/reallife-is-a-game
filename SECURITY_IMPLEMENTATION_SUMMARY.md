- **Request/response logging** with performance monitoring
- **Secure error handling** without information leakage
- **Context tracking** throughout request lifecycle

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Middleware Stack

The security middleware applies protections in this order:

1. **Request Logging** - Track all incoming requests
2. **Security Monitoring** - Detect suspicious patterns
3. **Method Validation** - Verify allowed HTTP methods
4. **Origin Validation** - Check request source legitimacy  
5. **Content-Type Validation** - Ensure proper data formats
6. **Rate Limiting** - Prevent abuse and DoS attacks
7. **CSRF Protection** - Validate state-changing operations
8. **Authentication** - Verify user identity
9. **Authorization** - Check permissions and roles
10. **Input Validation** - Sanitize and validate all data
